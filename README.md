SS316 and SS316L
Comparision Between the Material SS 316 and SS316L
| Property / Feature | SS 316 | SS 316L |    
| ------ | ---- |------ |
| Full Name | Stainless Steel 316 | Stainless Steel 316L (Low Carbon) |
| Carbon Content | Up to 0.08% |	Maximum 0.03% (L = Low Carbon) |
| Molybdenum Content (Mo) |	2.0% – 3.0% | 2.0% – 3.0% |
|Nickel (Ni) |	10.0% – 14.0% |	10.0% – 14.0% |
| Chromium (Cr) |	16.0% – 18.0% |	16.0% – 18.0% |
| Tensile Strength |	515 MPa (min) |	485 MPa (min) |
| Yield Strength (0.2% Offset) |	205 MPa (min) |	170 MPa (min) |
| Elongation at Break |	40% (typical)	| 40% (typical) |
| Hardness (Rockwell B) |	≤ 95 RB	| ≤ 95 RB |
| Magnetic Properties |	Non-magnetic in annealed condition |	Non-magnetic in annealed condition |
| Corrosion Resistance |	Excellent, especially in marine and acidic environments |	Better than 316 in highly corrosive & welded zones |
| Intergranular Corrosion Resistance |	Susceptible after welding due to carbide precipitation |	Superior, designed to avoid intergranular corrosion |
| Weldability |	Good, but may require post-weld heat treatment |	Excellent, low carbon prevents carbide precipitation |
| Heat Resistance (Scaling)| Up to 870°C (continuous), 925°C (intermittent) |	Similar, but not as strong at elevated temperatures |
| Cost |	Slightly cheaper |	Slightly more expensive (due to extra processing) |
| Machinability |	Similar for both grades |	Slightly better than SS 316 in some cases |
| Work Hardening |	Both harden rapidly when cold-worked |	Same as SS 316 |
| Density |	~8.00 g/cm³ |	~8.00 g/cm³ |
| Common Standards |	ASTM A240 / A312 / A213 / A276 |	ASTM A240 / A312 / A213 / A276 |
| Applications |	Pressure vessels, marine fittings, food processing |	High-purity systems, welded pipework, pharma, nuclear, chemical plants |
| Usage in Welding |	May require filler metals to avoid corrosion |	No filler needed; low carbon prevents weld decay |
| Availability |	Very common	| Also widely available in critical sectors |
| Post-Weld Heat Treatment |	Sometimes recommended |	Not required |
| Formability |	Good |	Good |
| Magnetic Permeability |	Low (near zero in annealed state) |	Low |
